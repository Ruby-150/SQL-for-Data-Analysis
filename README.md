📊 SQL for Data Analysis – Fashion Retail Dataset
This project demonstrates SQL techniques applied to a fashion retail dataset to perform exploratory data analysis, 
aggregation, and insights extraction. It simulates real-world scenarios involving product pricing, brand performance, and country-based analysis using structured queries.

📂 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes two tables:
fashion: Contains details like BrandName, Category, SellPrice, MRP, Discount, Sizes, Details.
brand_info: Contains brand metadata like Country and EstablishedYear.

🔍 Key SQL Concepts Applied
SELECT – Retrieve relevant columns for analysis
WHERE – Filter data based on conditions (e.g., high discounts, specific brands)
ORDER BY – Sort results by price, brand, or discount
GROUP BY – Aggregate data by brand, category, or country to get averages, counts, etc.
JOIN – Combine fashion and brand_info to enrich insights
SUBQUERIES – Perform nested queries to filter or rank data
CREATE VIEW – Create reusable summaries of brand performance
